### Group 4, Hedda Olimb and Ida Marie Joakimsen Bakken :princess::princess:

## Goal :pushpin:
The goal of this exam is to prove and demonstrate you have achieved the learning
outcomes, knowledge, skills and general competence described in the course
description.
It is specially important you show that:
• you understand and can build a full-stack modern web application using
the MERN stack;
• you can design a REST API following best practices;
• you can successfully document your projects using modern tools such
as swagger and Storybook;
• you can provide basic security to both backend and frontend;
• you can use modern developer tools such as task runners, bundlers, etc.

## Tasks :pencil2: 
Your goal is to develop this application by first integrating the functionalities of
assignments 2 and 3 and then creating the additional user interfaces to support the
new functionality. You also must make adaptations to the backend to support
authentication and authorisation roles for the different user types. If you want to
recycle and adapt the code, you have written in the previous obligs or if you want to
start from scratch is up to you. However, be aware that there are significant
adaptations to both the front-end and back end you need to make on your previous
code to pass this assignment (e.g., new user interfaces, additions to the database and
back-end code). The prototype sketches we provide in this document are only
suggestions to help you understand the task at hand. You can create your own
designs and if you put some effort in making webpages visual appealing and usable
it will be considered a plus. In the next section, we provide a summary of the
functional requirements for the application.

## Setup :wrench:
To install the application follow these instructions. (Make sure to set the correct information in your .ENV file including front-end host)

- Download the files from GitHub, or clone the project. 
- Open the project folder in an external editor. We have used Visual Studio Code during development.
- Open one terminal in the backend folder, and one in the frontend folder of the project and run npm install to install the project dependencies.
- Run the npm start command to start the application.
- Or, you can use the following commans in the terminal. 
```console
npm install
npm start
```
```console
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
